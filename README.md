# NFC-Card
An NFC card that links back to my github <br/>

With this NFC card I can more freely share my contacts with others and it also acts as a cool way to show my github.

Future Change Plans:
  Adding a personal website onto the card (I don't have one yet)
  Adding my irl name, number, and email (If done I don't be adding this onto the github for privacy reasons)
